# Pico Voltage Monitor

Displays voltage applied to pin 28 on a round LCD.  Display is time swept, very approximately 1 second per circuit, the previous second is displayed in dark green.

The markings are 0.5V apart, going up to 2.5V (or 1V apart going up to 5V if you divide the input voltage by reading from the middle of two identical resistors).
